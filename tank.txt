Tank-Nikoli
Nikoli was a war veteran he was in the paratroops regiment, he was deployed in many countires such as Araq, Korea, Vietnam and china. After lord Valad summoned
the dead and created his own army of orcs they first attacked all of the military bases, Nikoli was in Araq when their base was attacked army of 1000 orcs and
undead monsters against 60 vets it was a battle to the death. For 3 days they held there ground but the enemys numbers were to great. The 60 were cut down to 
15 they wouldnt last another night and they knew it they sent one man to send a message back to the other bases but the rest took postitions in the front line next
to there fallen brothers. AS they lay and wait for the enemy the blood from the fallen poured over them the sand stuck on their faces like a shroud changing them.
when the enemy drew near the reaming 14 rose from the sand they were like hunters that couldnt been seen, by using stealth they defeated the enemys one by one. 
when the men ran dry on ammunition they used there blades and when the blades went dull they used their hands. When the dust settled only one enemy remained running 
around the desert aimlessly traumatized of a force so strong, unbeatable it only can be described as supernatrual he called them ghosts.
